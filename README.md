## About

This project is a basic React application that demonstrates the use of components, JSX, and basic state management. It is not meant to be a fully functional app, but rather a learning exercise to get comfortable with React.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: You need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm is the package manager for Node.js and is required to install dependencies. npm comes with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.
## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
2. `npm install`
3. `npm build`

## Dev mode

`npm run dev`
